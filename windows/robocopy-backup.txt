C:\Users – It is the directory which I want to sync
\\HomeServer\Backup\Windows-PC\Users – Server Name is “HomeServer”, Share name is “Backup” and directory under Backup is “Windows-PC\Users”.

/DCOPY:DA – Copy Data and Attributes.
/MIR – It mirrors the entire directory tree C:\Users in destination. It also deletes destination files which no longer exists in C:\Users.
/FFT – This is to support FAT file systems which needs a tweak to support timestamp validation by copy logic in robocopy tool.
/Z – Copy operation can be resumed after termination.
/XA:SH – Exclude System (S) files and Hidden (H) files
/R:0 – Number of retries on failed copy operation. By default it does retry for 1 million times, which is useful in poor network.
/TEE – Output to console window and log file – In this case I haven’t used log file. You have to add “/LOG:file” option too.
/XJD – excluding Junction Points (symbolic link) of directories from copying
/XD AppData /XD OneDrive /XD SkyDrive – list of directories to be excluded from copying
